## Analysis Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to map the earthquakes with magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map along with earth techno plates boundries. The map generated has three layers i.e. Dark, Street and Satelite. 

## Data Resources:
- Earthquakes: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson
- Earthquakes above 4.5 magnitude: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/4.5_week.geojson
- Tecnotic Plates boundries: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fraxen/tectonicplates/master/GeoJSON/PB2002_boundaries.json

## Softwares: 
- HTML/CSS
- JavaScript
- LeafLet
